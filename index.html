            There were numerous 200'000'000 Years old cave paintings found
            across the globe, indicating a previous co-existence of Godzilla and
            Humans. They often portrayed clashes with different titans. There's
            even one painting showing ancient civilizations praying to Godzilla,
            seeing a God in him.

          <p>
            After hibernating for hundreds of millions of years, the nuclear
            bomb dropped on Hiroshima at the end of WWII is what made Godzilla
            wake up again. As the humans started to notice his presence, they
            tried to kill him with nuclear bombs. These attempts to kill him
            were covered up with the explanation that it was "just" bomb
            testing. All that, while not knowing that Godzilla actually feeds
            off radiation.

            In the modern day, Godzilla is battling off many titans that have
            awakaned alongside with him. Starting in the Year 2014, he faced off
            against MUTOs (Top left), 2019 he faced off against the three-headed
            dragon Ghidorah (Bottom middle) and most recently, in 2021 (film
            took place in 2024) he faced off against the mighty Kong (Top
            right).

            King Ghidorah is a three-headed dragon with alien origin. He fell on
            planet earth hundreds of millions of years ago, civilizations back
            then mistaking him for a meteorite. Due to him not being from
            earth-nature he reacts differently to certain environmental changes.
            While you mostly see him in the air with his gigantic wings, he is
            actually taller than Godzilla when he properly stands up for once.

            Kong is a 100m tall gorilla. Having absolutely no fear and respect
            for anyone, it makes him a force to be reckoned with. In fights, he
            has the same advantage as humans. He can use weapons. While all
            other titans primarly only fight with their body, Kong is capable of
            ripping out a massive tree and fight with it in one hand.

            Mechagodzilla is fully made out of the strongest steel and metal,
            making him unable to experience any pain at all. It's fully equipped
            with gigantic weapons, capable of dealing unbelievable damage or
            adding force to his punches. Apex Cybernetics, the creators of
            Mechagodzilla have also made an expiditon to the hollow earth,
            gathering the source of titan-power. This made Mechagodzilla capable
            of firing an extremely powerful beam of his mouth (red), similar to
            Godzilla's atomic breath (blue).

              Legendary Pictures' Godzilla origin story carries the weight of
              unwieldy expectations, but rather than buckle, it is ultimately a
              fantastic - though imperfect - example of the genre. Gareth
              Edwards both depicts what is beloved about this magnificent
              creature and creates a film that is distinctly its own entity, one
              that brings Godzilla to gorgeous new life. The Easter Eggs and
              nods to previous versions and additional suitmation favorites will
              likely be appreciated by sharp-eyed aficionados.

              Godzilla vs. Kong knows exactly what it wants to be, and invests
              every minute of its two hours living up to that promise. Somewhat
              understandably the humans are overshadowed by their enormous
              co-stars, but it is a glorious love letter to these iconic
              characters' collective histories, a satisfying culmination of the
              arc leading up to it, and, hopefully, a jumping-off point for more
              stories set in this universe. Let's hope it's not another
              half-century before these two crazy kids get together again.
